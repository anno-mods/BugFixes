Eg. show buildcosts of not yet unlocked ships/buildings or ones you don't have the permit for yet.\n Shows always -available/needed- buildcosts for buildings/ships.\n shows hitpoints of buildings in buildmenu.\n Show more Ship Stats when hovering over them in shiplist/traderoute screen.\n Always show buy/sell price of goods when hovering in Warehouse UI over them."
