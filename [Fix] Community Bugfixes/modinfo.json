    "1.011" : "Release on mod.io",
    "1.012" : "New mod.io ID because of bug (because it was hidden previously)",
    "1.013" : "Update 'Taludas_TransporterRange' to only clamp the transporter range for buildings in StandardStorageList (eg. to exclude Fuel Station)",
    "1.014" : "Update TooltipBugFixes (an incident resolver buff was no longer displayed, fixed)",
    "1.015" : "Update TooltipBugFixes (in rare cases shown percentage for buffs was 0).",
    "1.016" : "Add some translations thx MaxCheng95 and Satanoy Risopatr√≥n Echenique (feel free to contribute your language), add a few more small bugfixes (missing pools and typos) thanks Dark Listener.",
    "1.017" : "Add -infotip-jakob- which adds the current storage amount of goods to the infotip when you hover over product needs in the residence UI.\n And added my mod -MoreInfoTooltips-, which expands the information from tooltips (BUT may be incompatible to tooltip changes from other mods, so report back if tooltips look strange or you have errors/warnings in your logfile):\nShows more complete information in tooltips. Eg. show buildcosts of not yet unlocked ships/buildings or ones you don't have the permit for yet.\n Shows always -available/needed- buildcosts for buildings/ships.\n shows hitpoints of buildings in buildmenu.\n Show more Ship Stats when hovering over them in shiplist/traderoute screen.\n Always show buy/sell price of goods when hovering in Warehouse UI over them.",
    "1.018" : "Adjust 2 german texts.\nImprove the formatting for the current money value in buildcost tooltip, so big amounts are rounded.\nAdd the available amounts also to UpgradeCosts.",

ItemSets changed by mods also display the proper tooltip if loaded before 'shared_ItemsetTooltip_Serp'. To make new mod ItemSets also display the buff, see assets.xml of that shared mod for explanation.\nUpdate 'TooltipBugFixes_Serp': Buffs which add more Resolvers for Incidents now only display that once eg. '+1 Doctor', not 2 times anymore.",

Fixed."
